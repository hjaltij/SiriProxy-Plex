FAQ
--

1. After I say "on deck" siri just spins and does nothing
	There can be a number of reasons this happens but it basically means PMS didn't return any shows from onDeck.
	* Make sure your PMS server IP and port are correct in config.yml
	* Make sure you have the correct plex_tv_index set.
	* Verify in Plex that something is actually "on deck" 
	 
2. How do I find my TV index?
	* browse to: http://<your PMS server IP:32400/library/sections
	* View page source
	* Find the key for title of your your TV index
